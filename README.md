## Browser support
This component framework is built and dev tested in the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox. At some point it will be tested in Edge and Internet Explorer latest. 

It is built mobile-first and so is tested at various breakpoints and screen sizes - but actual device testing is scheduled for a later, more stable release.

It does not fully support Internet Explorer versions less than 10, most *definitely not* IE8. 

Suggestions and pull requests are welcome on supporting these legacy browsers but the main project focus wonâ€™t be to do this.
